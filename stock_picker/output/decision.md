    {
      "name": "FlutterFlow",
      "reason": "While FlutterFlow has reported remarkable growth of over 8,300% and is a leader in the no-code and low-code development space, its market potential appears more limited compared to the broader applications offered by Perplexity AI."

    {
      "name": "Cohere",
      "reason": "Cohere has a significant valuation of $6.8 billion and strong investor backing in the AI sector. However, its projected revenue growth of $200 million by 2025 does not match the potential return on investment expected from Perplexity AI's trajectory."
